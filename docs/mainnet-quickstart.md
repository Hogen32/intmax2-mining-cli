## Quick Start Guide For Base Mainnet

This guide explains how to start mining on the Intmax network using the intmax2 mining CLI. The instructions below describe the process for the Base Mainnet.

‚ùó Note: The tokens you receive through mining on the mainnet currently cannot be transferred to other addresses, but this feature will be enabled in the future.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- **Ethereum (ETH)**: A minimum of 1 ETH on Base mainnet plus additional ETH for gas fees.
- **Alchemy API key**: Please refer to the [How to get your Alchemy API key](./alchemy.md) guide to obtain your API key.
- **Withdrawal Private Key**: The private key of the address you'll use to withdraw ETH and receive ITX tokens.(Instruction for Metamask [here](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/secret-recovery-phrase-and-private-keys/how-to-export-an-accounts-private-key/))

## Download the CLI

1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/InternetMaximalism/intmax2-mining-cli/releases) page of this repository.
2. Download the ZIP file appropriate for your operating system.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Starting the Mining Process

1.  **Lauching the CLI** Double-click on the mining-cli shown in this image to launch.

> NOTICE: If you're using a Mac, you may see a message saying "Cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified" as shown in the image. In that case, you need to change your Mac's security settings by referring to this link: https://support.apple.com/en/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/instruction/mac0.png" width="200" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Select Network**:
When you double-click the CLI, you'll see a screen like this:

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p1.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

You can move the cursor with the arrow keys, select `mainnet` and press `Enter`.

2. **Continue**:
After selecting `mainnet`, you'll see a screen like this:

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p3.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Mining has transitioned from Ethereum Mainnet to Base Network hence you wont be able to create a new config for mining but you would be able to continue with, overwrite or modify the existing mining config file.

Here is the explanation of each setting:

- **Continue**: Continue mining with the existing settings in the config file
- **Overwrite**: This allows you to clear existing settings and set new ones.
- **Modify**: Modify some of the existing settings and change them, e.g, change withdrawal private key. Note that when using this method, mining times and mining unit cannot be changed.

3. **Enter password for the private key**:
If you choose to encrypt your password during setup, you'll be prompted to enter it. This step is optional and won't appear if you didn't set a password.

### Mining Process
1. **Mining**:
Mining has transitioned from Ethereum Mainnet to Base Network, hence you would not be able to mine at the moment. Look out for information for when mining starts on `Base`. 
   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p5.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Be rest assured that all your assets and ITX token are safe. To claim and retrieve the assets from Ethereum Mainnet, press `Enter` to continue.

### Claiming ITX Tokens

The deposits eligible for ITX tokens are confirmed at UTC 0:00 on the Monday two weeks after mining. After that, you claim ITX tokens.

1. **Select Mode**:
To claim ITX token, select `Claim`. You can check whether an deposit address is eligible for rewards in the "Qualified" column after selecting the mode.
   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p6.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Claim ITX Token To Withdrawal Address**:
If `Claim` was selected and your address qualifies for ITX tokens, the CLI automatically transfers your available ITX tokens to your withdrawal wallet immediately or when the token availablity time reaches. To see the tokens in your wallet, ensure to add the ITX mainnet token contract address to your wallet using the Network [guide](./holesky.md).

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m6.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Check wallet to see tokens.

After claiming process is done, you can proceed to retreiving available ETH in the Intmax2 Network back to your withdrawal address. Proceed by pressing any key as instructed by CLI.

### Withdraw ETH 

#### Important: Avoid making direct or indirect transfers between deposit and withdrawal addresses. Depositing in a withdrawal address will disqualify it from receiving rewards during mining. Please refer to the [README document](../README.md) for more information.

1. **Withdraw ETH**:
Select `Exit` to retrieve assets to withdrawal address.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p7.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Withdraw ETH To Withdrawal Address**:
Any pending deposit would be cancelled and all ETH balance will be withdrawn to your withdrawal address.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m8.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Note: If there are still ETH in your deposit address after this process, you can manually transfer ETH from deposit wallet to another wallet using the command below. Proceed by pressing any key as instructed by CLI.

### Exporting Deposit Private Keys

1. **Export**:
Select `Export`

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p8.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Export Deposit Private Key**:
Copy private key and import account into metamask using this [guide](https://support.metamask.io/managing-my-wallet/accounts-and-addresses/how-to-import-an-account/).

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m12.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

3. **Transfer in CLI**:
To transfer ETH balance inside the CLI instead, type yes and select `#0` or your account of choice if you have several deposit accounts.

   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m13.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

4. **Transfer ETH Balance**:
   Paste the address to transfer ETH balance to.
   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m14.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

5. **Transfer in CLI**:
Approve transfer by typing `Yes`.
   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m15.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

Repeat approval until ETH balance is insufficient. To end the process, press `Enter` key.
   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/migrate/m15.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

After withdrawal process is done, proceed by pressing any key as instructed by CLI.

### Check Available CLI Updates

1. **Select Mode**:
Select `Check Update` to check if you are using the latest version.
   <div align="center">
     <img src="../assets/mainnet-instruction/p9.png" width="600" alt="Mining CLI"></div>

2. **Confirm CLI Version**:
Your current version should be same as the latest release to mine on Base. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/InternetMaximalism/intmax2-mining-cli/releases) page of this repository to see the available latest version.
